Smooth 2nd -> 3rd para in Section 1
Section 1.1, add more references on live coding and 

in S2.1, repeat the final time 

Figure 7 change lasts to kernel sleeps  (caption: where 'Kernel.sleep' is
used here as placeholder to represent a computation lasting a particular length
of time). 

in section 3 explain figure 5 and discuss schedule ahead time accounting for
drift between sleeps

finish it off before 3.1 with a comparisonof the final time equation from Figure 4
and Figure 5.

discuss scheduled time in the model (parameter to 'runTime').

In section 4, mention 'time system' meaning again.

Beef up the abstract (and other parts) with 'time system' and 'time safety'. 

explain snoc list in 'core fragment' 

Sonic Pi is a mostly pure language, with first-class functions. Its impurity
arises from timing and output effects- we give a monadic description of this,
showing that it can be embedded in a pure language. 

tie where epsilon fits in the model, and identify this in the code. + discussion
link to schedAheadTop (emphasise lack of drift).

in example 1, say P = kernelSleep 2, and t = 1. 

mention 'time safety' in 5.1

dom: finish 5.1.1
